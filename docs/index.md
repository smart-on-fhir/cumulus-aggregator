# Cumulus Aggregator

The Cumulus Aggregator takes patient count data from an institution's
[Library](https://docs.smarthealthit.org/cumulus/library/) and makes it available to the
[Dashboard](https://docs.smarthealthit.org/cumulus/dashboard/).

It's called an "aggregator" because it can collect these patient counts from multiple institutions
and bundle them into a single data set for the Dashboard.
